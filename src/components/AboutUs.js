      Our company was founded by Kevin Leong as a way to show his love for his dog, Kelly. Kevin is a visually impaired entrepreneurial student who loves dogs and started making homemade dog treats for Kelly and for other friends with dogs. The treats got so
      popular that he decided to make them in larger quantities to share with dog lovers all over the country.
